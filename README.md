A CNN-based model with a simple Streamlit web app to classify MRI images as cancerous or non-cancerous.
This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors in MRI images. A streamlined web interface is built using Streamlit to provide an easy-to-use platform for medical image classification.

Features:
  - Deep Learning Model: Trained CNN for binary classification (Cancerous vs. Non-Cancerous).
  - Web Application: Interactive UI to upload MRI images and view predictions.
  - Real-Time Predictions: Outputs the classification result with confidence scores.

Tech Stack:
  - TensorFlow/Keras: For model training and evaluation.
  - Streamlit: To create a simple web interface.
  - Python: programming language.
